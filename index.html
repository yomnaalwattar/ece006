<h4>Breif introduction to programming languages:</h4>
</hr>
<p>A programming language is a computer language programmers use to develop software programs, scripts, or other sets of instructions for computers to execute.mainly programming languages referes to high level languages.Each programming language contains a unique set of keywords and syntax, which are used to create a group of instructions. Many languges have developed till now,but each language has a specific purpose .Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. Many programming languages are written in an imperative form amd other are declaritive ans sime are of high level and the other of low level. But the widely used programming languages are of high levels. The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.</p>

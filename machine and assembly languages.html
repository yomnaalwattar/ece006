<h4>The following table illustrate the diffrences of machine and assembly languages.</h4>
</br>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Machine-level language</th>
    <th>assenbly-level language</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The machine-level language comes at the lowest level in the hierarchy, so it has zero abstraction level from the hardware.</td>
    <td>The assembly language comes above the machine language means that it has less abstraction level from the hardware.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It cannot be easily understood by humans.</td>
    <td>It is easy to read, write, and maintain.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The machine-level language is written in binary digits, i.e., 0 and 1.</td>
    <td>The assembly language is written in simple English language, so it is easily understandable by the users.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It does not require any translator as the machine code is directly executed by the computer.</td>
    <td>In assembly language, the assembler is used to convert the assembly code into machine code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It is a first-generation programming language.</td>
    <td>It is a second-generation programming language</td>

  <tr>
    <td>It is a user-friendly language as this language is written in simple English words, which can be easily understood by humans.</td>
    <td>It is a machine-friendly language, i.e., the computer understands the machine language, which is represented in 0 or 1.</td>
  <tr>
    <td>It executes at a faster pace.</td>
    <td>The low-level language takes more time to execute.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>It requires the compiler to convert the high-level language instructions into machine code.</td>
    <td>It requires the assembler to convert the assembly code into machine code.</td>
  <tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The high-level code can run all the platforms, so it is a portable language.</td>
    <td>The machine code cannot run on all machines, so it is not a portable language.</td>
